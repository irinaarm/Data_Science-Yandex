## Goal

To develop a model for anonymizing personal data of insurance company clients

## Description

It is necessary to develop an algorithm for encrypting the data of insurance company customers.

The data conversion method must meet the requirements:
- It should be difficult to recover personal information from the converted data.
- When converting data, the quality of machine learning models should not deteriorate.
