## [Oil well location selection](https://github.com/irinaarm/Data_Science_Yandex/blob/main/07_ML_in_business%20(oil%26gas)/project_oil_wells_eng.ipynb)
## Goal

To build a machine learning model that will help determine the region of drilling a new well where production will bring the highest profit.

## Description

There is data on oil samples in three regions: 10,000 fields in each, where the quality of oil and the volume of its reserves were measured.

Tasks:

- Perform data analysis
- Apply a Linear Regression model to predict the volume of raw materials in a field based on a set of features in the data
- Analyze possible profits and risks with Bootstrap technology
- Select the region with the lowest probability of losses with a given budget limit for drilling a well.

## Libraries

**`Pandas`,
`NumPy`,
`Matplotlib`,
