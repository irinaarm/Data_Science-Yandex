## [Customers churn prediction](https://github.com/irinaarm/Data_Science_Yandex/blob/main/06_supervised_learning%20(banking)/project_bank_eng.ipynb)

## Goal

To build a machine learning model for predicting the fact of a bank customer's departure (binary classification)

## Description

There is historical data on customer behaviour and termination of contracts with the bank.

It is necessary to build a machine learning model to predict the customer's churn from the bank in the near future. Select the model with the largest possible value of the `F1` measure. The maximum value of the metric is `0.59`. Use additional `AUC-ROC` metric.

## Libraries

**`Pandas`,
`NumPy`,
