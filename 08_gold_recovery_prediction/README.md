## [Gold recovery prediction](https://github.com/irinaarm/Data_Science_Yandex/blob/main/08_gold_recovery_prediction/gold_recovery_eng.ipynb)

## Goal

To build a machine learning model to predict the concentration of gold at different stages during the purification process of gold-bearing ore.

## Description

It is necessary to build a model that can predict the recovery rate of gold from gold-bearing ore based on data with extraction and purification parameters. The model will help optimize production to avoid launching an enterprise with unprofitable characteristics.


Tasks:

- Analyze the data
- Build regression models to predict the concentration of gold
- Assess the quality of the model prediction, a custom quality metric used â€” `sMAPE` (symmetric mean absolute percentage deviation)

## Libraries

**`Pandas`,
`NumPy`,
`Matplotlib`,
`Scikit-learn`**
